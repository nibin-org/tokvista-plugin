## Description (paste-ready)

Tokvista helps design and engineering teams move Figma Variables to code faster.

What you can do:

- Sync local Figma variables and preview token output
- Import token JSON back into Figma variables
- Download token exports as:
  - W3C-style `tokens.json`
  - CSS variables
  - SCSS variables
  - Tailwind config
- Review change diffs before publishing
- Publish tokens through a secure Tokvista relay endpoint

Typical workflow:

1. Sync variables from your file
2. Review preview + pending changes
3. Download or publish to your configured project

Tokvista is built for teams using design tokens as a shared source of truth across design and development.
